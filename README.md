Hey, guys. If you want to test the app, please remember to switch all the API key with yours in the build.gradle file.

#Project1 Popular Movies App
#Project2 Stock Hawk App
Stock Hawk is an app which shows a customized list of stocks with both overall information and detailed bid price graph. The app has been well modified to be accessible to sight-impaired users and be able to be localized for any distribution in other countries. Widgets are also allowed to add in this app. Muliti-libraries were leveraged to keep the app tidy and clear.
#Project3 Make it bigger
